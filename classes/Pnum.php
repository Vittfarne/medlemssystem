 *
 * DOCUMENTATION
 * =============
 *
 * All functions return (bool) false if there are some sort
 * of error. Note that some of the functions can return 0,
 * so you need to check the type of the return value.
 * All functions are public static, so you don't need to
 * instantiate this class.
 *
 * Example:
 * include_once('pnum.class.php');
 * if(Pnum::check($_POST['personal_number'])) {
 *    echo "The personal number is correct";
 * }
 *
 *
 * function checksum($pnum)
 *    Return: (int) the checksum number
 *    Will calculate the checksum for a personal number.
 *    The checksum is the last value of the personal number
 *    and can be used to verify that the number is entered
 *    correctly.
 *    This function does not do much format checking. Make
 *
 * function check($pnum, $personal_only = true)
 *    Return: (bool) false on incorrect number
 *    This function will check if an entered personal or
 *    company number is correct. By default it will only
 *    check for personal numbers (it will do a date check,
 *    which will fail for company numbers). Change the
 *    second parameter to false to disable the date check.
 *
 * function datecheck($pnum)
 *    Return: (bool) true if it's a correct date part
 *    Check that the date part of a personal number
 *    is in fact a date. Note that this will not work for
 *    company numbers.
 *
 * function gender($pnum)
 *    Return: (int) 1 = male, 2 = female, false = error
 *    Which gender is this personal number belonging to?
 *    Will do a check and datecheck to see that it's
 *    correctly formated.
 *
 * function ispersonal($pnum)
 *    Return (bool) true if it is a personal number
 *    This is actually an alias for check($pnum, true)
 *
 * function iscompany($pnum)
 *    Return: (bool) true if it is a company number
 *    Note that this function does not detect private
 *    companies (enskilda firmor) since their company number
 *    is the same as the owners personal number.
 *
 * function company($pnum)
 *    Return: (string) see below
 *    false = incorrect format or not a company number
 *    'OF' = Government, county or municipality ("offentlig")
 *    'AB' = stock company (aktiebolag)
 *    'EK' = economic association (ekonomisk fÃ¶rening)
 *    'IF' = non-profit association (ideell fÃ¶rening)
 *    'HB' = General or limied partnership (handels-/kommandit-bolag)
 *    true = other, undefined company type
 *    Note that this functions does not detect private
 *    companies (enskilda firmor). See iscompany() above.
 *
 * function filter($pnum)
 *    Return: (string) filtered personal number
 *    Filters the input to the other functions so it is in
 *    a general form. It removes everything except numbers
 *    (which, of course, is wrong if you want to save the
 *    personal number, because personal numbers can have
 *    a - or a + as a delimiter, with different meanings).
 *    It also checks to see if you have provided century
 *    numbers and removes them.
 *    We discourage outside use of this function.
